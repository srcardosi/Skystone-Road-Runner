This is the field layout in the Road Runner coordinate system.
                 (+x)
                   |
                   |
                   | f (foundation)
                   |
                   |
(+y)-------------(0,0)-------------(-y)
                   |
                   | s (stones)
                   | s
                   | s
                   |
                 (-x)

The boundaries are somewhere around 63.


Add Marker was confusing so this is an example.

.addMarker(new Vector2d(45,-28), () -> {
           sleep(4000);
           return Unit.INSTANCE;
})

Except don't sleep. The robot will keep moving but won't update its location.
Put something like moving a servo there instead.
